My Neovim config using [NixVim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) (Neovim distribution configured with the nix language)
## Using my config
If you have nix(The package manager) installed,  you can run my config with:
```shell
nix run 'github:antoniodrumond/nixvim'
```
## Credits
+ Most of my config was made using [elythh](https://github.com/elythh)'s config as a basis. It can be found [here](https://github.com/elythh/nixvim).
